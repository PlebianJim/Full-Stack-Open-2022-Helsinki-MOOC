    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the code used to build and structure web pages. It inlcludes
        many different types of "tags" that are used to provide semantic meaning and structure to the page.</p>
    <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Various tpyes of headings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The structure and page is built through a series of "elements" which wrap, encapsulate or enclose the various
        content on the page as well as styled in various different ways using inline, internal or external CSS. Each of
        these elements are enlcosed by "tags" that can provide extra functionality (such as an &lt a &gt tag to "anchor"
        the element to an outside link)</p>
    <h3>What makes up an HTML element?</h3>

            Basics page</a> and is used to visually represent the various parts that make up an HTML element:</p>

    <p>We can see that the <strong>content</strong> of the element is encapsulated within two <strong>tags</strong>; one <strong>opening </strong> tag and one <strong>closing </strong> tag</p>
