    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the code used to build and structure web pages. It inlcludes
        many different types of "tags" that are used to provide semantic meaning and structure to the page.</p>
    <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Various tpyes of headings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The structure and page is built through a series of "elements" which wrap, encapsulate or enclose the various
        content on the page as well as styled in various different ways using inline, internal or external CSS. Each of
        these elements are enlcosed by "tags" that can provide extra functionality (such as an &lt a &gt tag to "anchor"
        the element to an outside link)</p>
    <h3>What makes up an HTML element?</h3>
    <p>This image is taken from the <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">MDN HTML
            Basics page</a> and is used to visually represent the various parts that make up an HTML element:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
        alt="Anatomy of an HTML Element">
    <p>We can see that the <strong>content</strong> of the element is encapsulated within two <strong>tags</strong>; one
        <strong>opening </strong> tag and one <strong>closing </strong> tag
    </p>
    <p>This image is alos taken from the <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">MDN HTML
            Basics page</a> and is used to show the inclusion of an attribute (specifcally a class):</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
        alt="Anatomy of an HTML Element">
    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>Attributes provide extra context or information to an element. In the image above, a class name has been added to
        element. <strong>Class</strong> is the attribute and <strong>"editor-note"</strong> is the value that has been
        assigned to it.</p>
    <p>Attributes that set values will always have:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A space between the element name and itself</li>
        <li>The attribute that is being calleds name followed by an "=" symbol</li>
        <li>The value that is being assigned to the attribute enclosed by speech marks</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Nesting Elements</h3>
    <p>Nesting elements is the practice of enclosing an element wihtin another element. This can be used for various
        reasons such as anchoring links, turning an image into a buttin or simply making a word more
        <strong>bold</strong> or <em>emphasised</em>. Here is an example of how a nested element should be structured:
    </p>
    <p class="html-example">&lt;p&gt;My pigeon is tiny but &lt;strong&gt;incredibly&lt;/strong&gt;vicious.&lt/p&gt;</p>
    <p>The &lt;strong&gt; element is nested inside the &lt;p&gt; element and show shows it on the same line</p>
    <h3>Void</h3>
    <p>A void element is an element type that has no inner content and no closing tag. The &lt;img&gt; element is a good
        example of this:</p>
    <p class="html-example">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"/&gt;</p>
    <p>It contains 2 attributes but does not require a closing tag. This is partly beacuase it's purpose is to enbed the
        image in the place</p>
    <h3>Basic Tags and Their Uses</h3>
    <h4>Headings</h4>
    <p>Headings are used to separate logical chunks of connected text and organise prose. In HTML, heading tags are
        ordered from 1-6 to show greater or lesser importance. Think of tthe headings as serving similar purposes as:
    </p>
    <p><em>The &lt;h1&gt; tag is the largest and most important heading. Use it to convey the main title or purpose of
            the page</em></p>
    <h1>The main title of the page (&lt;h1&gt;)</h1>
    <p><em>The &lt;h2&gt; tag is then used for things like the introduction in an essay or the first point or section of
            the page</em></p>
    <h2>A top level sub-heading (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
    <p><em>The &lt;h3&gt; tag is then used for subsections of the &lt;h2&gt; section</em></p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: none;">A sub-level heading or subsection (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
    <p><em>The &lt;h4&gt; tag is then used for subsections of the &lt;h3&gt; section</em></p>
    <h4>A subsection (&lt;h4&gt;)</h4>
    <p><em>The &lt;h5&gt; tag is then used for subsections of the &lt;h4&gt; section</em></p>
    <h5>A subsection (&lt;h5&gt;)</h5>
    <p><em>The &lt;h6&gt; tag is then used for subsections of the &lt;h5&gt; section</em></p>
    <h6>A subsection (&lt;h6&gt;)</h6>
    <p>In visually simpler terms:</p>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: none;">Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    <p>Headings are an important aspect of effective SEO design</p>
    <h3>Parapgraphs</h3>
    <p>Paragraph elements (&lt;p&gt;) are used for containing paragraphs of text (!)</p>
    <p>That's about it</p>
    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>There are two types of list in HTML each of which require two elements to effectively present a list. The two
        types are "unordered lists" (&lt;ul&gt;) and "ordered lists" (&lt;ol&gt;)</p>
    <h4>Unordered lists - Shopping lists, notes, objectives. Anything that does not neccesarily need to be done in a
        specific order</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Feed pigeon</li>
        <li>Run away from pigeon</li>
        <li>Hope pigeon forgets about me</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Ordered Lists - Instructions, recipes etc. Anything that requires the list items to be done in order</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your IDE</li>
        <li>Type &lt;ol&gt; and hit return. It should automatically complete the closing tag for you</li>
        <li>Inside the new ordered list type &lt;li&gt; to create a list item element. Again, most IDE's will auto
            complete the closing tag for you</li>
        <li>Type the steps between the tags</li>
        <li>Congratualtions, you have made an ordered list!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>Links are the backbone of the internet. You can link to other pages, other sites, other areas of the same page
        etc. Adding links is very simple:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an anchor tag (&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)</li>
        <li>Type the content between the angle brackets where the opening and closing tags meet (&lt;a&gt;Content to be
            clicked&lt;/a&gt;)</li>
        <li>Now we need to provide the anchor tag with a href (hyperlink reference) attribute that it will link to when
            clicked:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents"&gt;Content to be clicked&lt;/a&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Save and check the live page. The link will most likley now be blue with an underline like this:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents">Helsinki Full Stack 2022 MOOC</a></li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
