    <h3>What Are Web Forms?</h3>
    <p>A web form is a simple form of interaction between a user and a web app. They allow the user to send data either
        to a web server or used on the client-side to update the page in some meaningful way. Examples of this would be
        updating a list, showing a UI feature, adding a product to a basket or joining a mailing list</p>
    <h4>Form Controls</h4>
    <p>Form controls or widgets are used to build the form and provide interactivity or purpose. They are generally
        created using the &lt;form&gt; elemtn and can provide the user with various ways of inputting the data. These
        include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>single line text fields</li>
        <li>multi line text fields</li>
        <li>radio buttons</li>
        <li>checkboxes</li>
        <li>dropdown boxes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Form Validation</h4>
    <p>Form validation refers to the fact that the form controls can be programmed to enforce or require specific
        formats or values when input. They are generally paired with text labels to provide semantic meaning as well as
        express the purpose of the form or it's various parts</p>
    <h3>Form Design</h3>
    <p>The MDN <a href="">Your First Form</a> page, suggests the following further reading for UX design:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>The above are suggested articles for digging deeper into UX design specifically related to forms</p>
    <p>Below, I follow along with their guide on creating a simple contact form. The mock up that is provided by MDN
        looks like this:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form/form-sketch-low.jpg"
        alt="MDN form mock up - Your First Form">
    <p>The form will contain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Three text fields</li>
        <li>One button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And be built using the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;form&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;label&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;input&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;textarea&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;button&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pressing the button will send the included data to a web server</p>
    <p>Here is the link to the completed form: <a href="form.html">The Form</a></p>
    <h3>The &lt;form&gt; element</h3>
    <p>All forms will start with the &lt;form&gt; element. It is a container element that formally defines the form and
        semantically marks it as such. It has some inherrent attributes as well as supporting specific attributes to
        tell the form how to behave and how to process the information included in it. Most of the attributes are
        optional but it is generally considered goofd practice to include at the very least the <strong>action</strong>
        and <strong>method</strong> attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Action: Defines the URL where the collected data will be sent once submitted</li>
        <li>Method: defines the type of metho to send the data (usually either POST or GET)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is the example code for this first stage:</p>
    <p class="code-example">&lt;form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post"&gt;...&lt;/form&gt;</p>
    <h3>The &lt;label&gt;, &lt;input&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt; elements</h3>
    <p>There will be 3 very simple data entry areas with a connected &lt;label&gt;:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The input field for the name is a single-line text field</li>
        <li>The input field for the email is an input of type email. This is a single-line text area that only accepts
            email addresses. An error will be thrown to the screen should a domain name not be included</li>
        <li>The input filed for the message that will be sent is a &lt;textarea&gt; which is a multiline text field</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the addition of these form controls (or widgets), the code now looks like this:</p>
    <p class="code-example">&lt;form action="/my-handling-form-page"
        method="post"&gt;...&lt;/form&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ul&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;label
        for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type="text" id="name"
        name="user_name"/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;label
        for="mail"&gt;Email:&lt;/label&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input type="email" id="mail"
        name="user_email"/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;label
        for="msg"&gt;Message:&lt;/label&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;textarea id="msg"
        name="user_message"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;
    </p>
    <p>The &lt;li&gt; elements are used to format the form and code and make styling simpler. An explicit label is used
        for each form control (widget) for usability and accessibility. This is added to by the use of a
        <strong>for</strong> attribute on each &lt;label&gt; element which is provided with an <strong>id</strong> that
        matches the <strong>for</strong> attribute in each label. This is to associate each form control with each label
    </p>
    <p>This is becuase associating a label with the form control/widget enables a whole bunch of features such as mouse,
        trackpad and touch device activation. A user using any of those different input methods can simply click it to
        activate it as well as providing semantic meaning for users making use of screen readers</p>
    <p>With the &lt;input&gt; element, the <strong>type</strong> attribute is the most important to add. It defines the
        way in which the &lt;input&gt; element will be presented and behave</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the example, the first input has a <strong>type</strong> of text. This will display a single-lline text
            field that accepts any text input</li>
        <li>The second input has a type of <strong>email</strong>. Again, this is a single-line text area but this
            particular area will require a well-formed email address. It turns the filed into an "intelligent" field
            that perfroms a little bit of validiation to ensure that it includes an @ symbol</li>
        <li>The third input does not exist but does include &lt;textarea&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The &lt;button&gt; element</h3>
    <p>The final aspect needed to make the form functional is a button that allows the input data to be sent to the
        designated server/location. This is achieved by including a &lt;button&gt; element</p>
    <p>The example code for this form looks like this:</p>
    <p class="code-example">&lt;li class="button"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;button type="submit"&gt;Send your
        message&lt;/button&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;</p>
    <p>This is placed just above the closing &lt;/ul&gt; tag in the HTML</p>
    <p>The &lt;button&gt; element also needs a <strong>type</strong> attribute with one of three different values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>submit:</strong> sends the data included in the form to the web page that has been defined inside
            the <strong>action</strong> attribute on the &lt;form&gt; element</li>
        <li><strong>reset:</strong> resets all widgets to their default value</li>
        <li><strong>button</strong> does nothing unless fucntionality is added through JavaScript. Allows you to define
            your own functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Styling the form</h3>
    <p>To view the CSS used to style the sheet, check the dev console or page source</p>
    <h3>Sending the form data to the web server</h3>
    <p>The &lt;form&gt; element defines where and how to senf the data. These two aspects are defined by the <strong>action</strong> and <strong>method</strong> attributes</p>
    <p>A <strong>name</strong> attribute is added to each form control element (input element). Whatever is written in that attribute is attached to the data entered into the related field as metadata. This is the <em>name</em> part of <em>name/value</em> pairs. Whatever is written into the field is attached to the <strong>name</strong> attribute. When this is sent to the server, the script that runs on the server to handle sent data evaluates the data included in each <em>name</em> and then organises or palces it into the relevant database entry</p>
    <p>So in the example form, the <em>names</em> of the name value pairs are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>user_name</li>
            <li>user_email</li>
            <li>user_message</li>
        </ol>
    <p>On the server/database, there will be a section that corresponds to each of the above names. The form is sent (pairing the <em>name</em> and the <em>value</em> of each into a <em>name/value pair</em>), evaluated and then organised into the ocrrect section</p>
